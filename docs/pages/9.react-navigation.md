# Integrate AppBar with react-navigation

## What we need

Before we start we have to install few things. First of all `react-native-paper`. If you don't have it in your app yet check our guide how to get it [here](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/getting-started.html).

After that we can start installing `react-navigation` using yarn:
```
yarn add @react-navigation/native
```
or npm:
```
npm install @react-navigation/native
```

In addition to that we have to install few more libraries:

yarn:
```
yarn add react-native-reanimated react-native-gesture-handler react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context @react-native-community/masked-view
```
npm:
```
npm install react-native-reanimated react-native-gesture-handler react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context @react-native-community/masked-view
```

#### Note:
If you are using react-native 0.60 or higher, linking is automatic. In other case you have to run `react-native link`.

The last step is to put import of `react-native-gesture-handler` on top of entry file (usually `app.js` or `index.js`)
```
import 'react-native-gesture-handler';
```

You can find full guide on installing `react-navigation` on [official site](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started).

## Using react-nativation

We can start using react-nativation by creating a basic navigation stack. Let's create two screens. Main screen named `Home` and details screen named `Details`.

```js
import 'react-native-gesture-handler';
import React from 'react';
import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';
import { createStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/stack';
const Stack = createStackNavigator();
export default function App() {
  return (
    <NavigationContainer>
      <Stack.Navigator initialRouteName="Home">
        <Stack.Screen name="Home" component={HomeScreen} >
        <Stack.Screen name="Details" component={DetailsScreen} />
      </Stack.Navigator>
    </NavigationContainer>
  );
}
```

Now our navigation stack contains two screens and will render `HomeScreen` or `DetailsScreen` components according to current navigation state. But we have not implemented those components yet. Let's do this then:

```js
import React from 'react';
import {View, Text, Button, StyleSheet} from 'react-native';
function HomeScreen() {
  return (
    <View style={style.container}>
      <Text>Home Screen</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
function DetailsScreen() {
  return (
    <View style={style.container}>
      <Text>Details Screen</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
const style = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
});
```

Once we have that we can run the app and check how Stack looks like.

To navigate from `HomeScreen` to `DetailsScreen` we can use navigation object provided by `Stack.Screen` component. Every component rendered by `Stack.Screen` have access to navigation object via props. Let's modify our `HomeScreen` component:

```js
function HomeScreen({ navigation }) {
  return (
    <View style={style.container}>
      <Text>Home Screen</Text>
      <Button
        title="Go to details"
        onPress={() => navigation.navigate('Details')}
      />
    </View>
  );
}
```

Our result:

Now we can navigate between two screens, but we are not done yet.


### Adding AppBar

We can customize Stack's header by passing custom component:

```js
export default function App() {
  return (
    <NavigationContainer>
      <Stack.Navigator
        initialRouteName="Home"
        screenOptions={{
          header: CustomNavigationBar,
        }}>
        <Stack.Screen name="Home" component={HomeScreen} />
        <Stack.Screen name="Details" component={DetailsScreen} />
      </Stack.Navigator>
    </NavigationContainer>
  );
}
```

Now we can implement `CustomNavigationBar` using `AppBar`:

```js
import { Appbar } from 'react-native-paper';
function CustomNavigationBar() {
  return (
    <Appbar.Header>
      <Appbar.Content title="My awesome app" />
    </Appbar.Header>
  );
}
```

We want to see application title on main screen and back arrow button on other screens. We can pass navigation props to our `CustomNavigationBar` component. That way we can know if we are on main screen or not.

First let's pass navigation props to `CustomNavigationBar`:

```js
export default function App() {
  return (
    <NavigationContainer>
      <Stack.Navigator
        initialRouteName="Home"
        screenOptions={{
          header: (props) => <CustomNavigationBar {...props} />,
        }}>
        <Stack.Screen name="Home" component={HomeScreen} />
        <Stack.Screen name="Details" component={DetailsScreen} />
      </Stack.Navigator>
    </NavigationContainer>
  );
}
```

Now we can check if navigation have previous state. If it has we can render back arrow button, otherwise we will render app name as before.

```js
function CustomNavigationBar({ navigation, previous }) {
  return (
    <Appbar.Header>
      {previous ? <Appbar.BackAction onPress={navigation.goBack} /> : null}
      <Appbar.Content title="My awesome app" />
    </Appbar.Header>
  );
}
```

We can easily add additional actions with `Appbar.Action` to our app. For example menu button and let's make it render only on the main screen.

```js
function CustomNavigationBar({navigation, previous}) {
  return (
    <Appbar.Header>
      {previous ? <Appbar.BackAction onPress={navigation.goBack} /> : null}
      <Appbar.Content title="My awesome app" />
      {!previous ? <Appbar.Action icon="menu" onPress={() => console.log('open menu')} /> : null}
    </Appbar.Header>
  );
}
```

![navigationAppBar4](screenshots/react-navigation-appBar4.gif)

And that's all we need. We have app bar that contains all we need to navigate through screens and access additional menu on main screen. As you can see with Material design `Appbar` provided by `react-native-paper` used with `react-navigation` we can easily create app that looks and works great.
